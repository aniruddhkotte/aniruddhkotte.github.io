## Welcome to my first GitHub Page

Here I'm gonna write all about my projects done during the Android Basics course taken from Udacity - Google Scholarship Program.
The course was started on Feb 14th 2018 and went on for 3 months upto May 14th 2018.

So, here is the list of my apps:

### Happy Birthday

This is the very first app I have created during he course. It's just a simple Birthday Card.

```markdown
Topics I have learnt:

- Basic android app structure
- How the views and layouts work
- ImageView
- TextView

_Here, let's take a look at how finally the app looked like._

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aniruddhkotte/aniruddhkotte.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
